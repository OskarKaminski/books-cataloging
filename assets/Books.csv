But in quieter moments most of us would admit that we need much more if we are to live a fulfilling life. (https://www.notion.so/In-recent-years-Australians-have-been-acting-as-though-they-have-found-the-answer-what-is-the-meanin-28f03d77e14c40f699cb86926fd2c48c?pvs=21), The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.

But, instead of witnessing the end of economics, we live in a time when economics and its concerns are more dominant than ever before. Instead of our growing wealth freeing us of our materialist preoccupations, it seems to have had the opposite effect. People in affluent countries are now even more obsessed with money and material acquisition, and the richer rhey are the more this seems to be the case. As a rule, no matter how much money people have they feel they need more. (https://www.notion.so/The-1960s-and-1970s-saw-a-flood-of-literature-predicting-a-future-in-which-technological-progress-wo-0bd76ec8e1854a4a85ec3ea8cadaad7c?pvs=21), “I hoped that getting to this income level would make me feel contented. I do have more stuff, but it doesn’t seem to have done the trick. I obviously need to set my goals higher. I’m sure I’ll be happy when I’m earning an extra $10 000 because then I’ll be able to buy the other things I want.” - Of course, raising the threshold of desire in this way creates an endless cycle of self-deception: like the horizon, our desires always seem to stay ahead of where we are. This cycle of hope and disappointrnent lies at the heart of consumer capitalism. Our new discontent causes us to set our goals higher still.

One of the earliest commentators on this was Thorstein Veblen who coined the phrase ‘conspicuous consumption’ in his 1899 book “The Theory of the Leisure Class”. For their part, the masses watch the behaviour of the rich with a mixture of awe, envy and scorn. (https://www.notion.so/Extravagance-serves-as-a-device-whereby-the-rich-differentiate-themselves-from-the-mass-of-the-popul-97ba3152966c4de8acf994034330aec0?pvs=21), Surveys in which respondents were asked to define their social position have shown fewer and fewer people willing to identify themselves as working class. Indeed, 93 per cent of Australians believe they are in the middle-income bracket (that is, the middle 60 per cent) and only 6.4 per cent see themselves in the bottom 20 per cent and 0.7 per cent in the top 20 per cent. The confusion about the incomes of others is that emulation of the spending and consumption habits of the wealthy, which was once confined to the upper levels of the middle class.

Television and magazines play a crucial role in this racheting-up process, not so much through advertising but more through presenting opulence as normal and attainable.

The goods are secondary because first of all you buy into a brand, then you buy the products. CEO of Gucci says - “Luxury brands are more than the goods. The goods are secondary because first of all you buy into a brand, then you buy the products. They give people the opportunity to live a dream” (https://www.notion.so/Today-almost-all-buying-is-to-some-degree-an-attempt-to-create-or-renew-a-concept-of-self-The-good-6221771c49a04fcd955cd4ace5cbf744?pvs=21), A vast marketing infrastructure has developed to help us manufacture ideal selves and to supply the goods to fill the gap between the actual and the ideal. Clothes, cars, and houses are, perfect for providing the bridge between who we actually are and who we want to be seen to be because they act as the interface between the self and the world.

The more materialistic we become the more we try to cope with our insecurities through consuming, and the less contented we are. It also suggests that more materialism means poorer relationships.

Two hundred dollars for a pair is now regarded as cheap. It is not unusual for young men and women with weekly incomes of $420 to spend $450 0n a pair of sunglasses and to own two or three pairs.

In fact, the independence De Beers toured is more a manifestation of self-centred isolation: ‘Your left hand says we, your right hand says me’ runs one of the ads. “It is a token of love from you to yourself”. It would be hard to find a better definition of narcissism.

Rebellion has become one of the emotions targeted by marketers, who unashamedly turn attempts to escape the fetters of convention into their exact opposite.

In the process, the owners project their desires onto their pets, and these desires must then be fulfilled. (https://www.notion.so/Much-of-the-impulse-to-anthropomorphise-pets-finds-its-origins-in-the-desire-to-demonstrate-love-for-10f94bab2284473f88ef591c84c39bae?pvs=21), The working lives of Australia’s best-paid psychologists are not devoted to treating the distress of people with psychological problems: they are devoted to developing ways of increasing consumers’ insecurity, vulnerability and obsessiveness. They work in marketing. Neoliberal economists insist that advertising is valuable because it provides information for consumers, but people working in the industry readily concede that it is far more effective to make people feel inadequate than it is to inform them about the useful features of a product. (https://www.notion.so/The-working-lives-of-Australia-s-best-paid-psychologists-are-not-devoted-to-treating-the-distress-of-2fc75f79532d4299a8cba3a6cbd3309a?pvs=21), Sometimes advertisers try to make us laugh or make us think, but mostly they make us feel deprived, inadequate or anxious. It is axiomatic that they make us feel bad in a way that can be cured by possession of the product they advertise. Lifestyle programs reinforce the message of advertising by making us feel discontented about the size of our house or the quality of our appliances. (https://www.notion.so/Sometimes-advertisers-try-to-make-us-laugh-or-make-us-think-but-mostly-they-make-us-feel-deprived--adce264e416b4319adba9c4dea7cb22f?pvs=21), With the advent of Botox, which really does get rid of wrinkles, makers of anti-wrinkle creams have begun to point out how much character older faces have. Wrinkles now need to be ‘softened’ rather than removed.

They concentrate their efforts on creating and sustaining the intangible features of consumer products that give them most of their value, that is, the brand. (https://www.notion.so/Marketing-has-become-the-foundation-on-which-large-corporations-are-now-built-They-concentrate-thei-b2d47e0380d94112acf4146a261d2b37?pvs=21), ‘Orderly marketing is a built-in feature of how we do business in Australia. We have to keep our margins up. The Australian marketplace is too small to cut each other’s throats. If we get into a price war with competitors, the only winner is the customer’. (https://www.notion.so/Orderly-marketing-is-a-built-in-feature-of-how-we-do-business-in-Australia-We-have-to-keep-our-marg-8fa2d71494d54a89956f4411fe0abb37?pvs=21), The unspoken role of marketing is to keep consumers in the richest societies in human history feeling deprived. (https://www.notion.so/The-unspoken-role-of-marketing-is-to-keep-consumers-in-the-richest-societies-in-human-history-feelin-6be4cdbed98742ecaf057531241928e7?pvs=21), To be successful in the long term, advertising must sell not only products but also a very particular kind of world view - one where happiness can be bought, where problems can be solved by a product, and where having more things is the measure of success. (https://www.notion.so/To-be-successful-in-the-long-term-advertising-must-sell-not-only-products-but-also-a-very-particula-9ad5dd3ddaf14941aa92c520df7ac947?pvs=21), Buying products… we are forced to choose and to wrestle with a suspicion that we are probably being ripped off. If we had the time to carry out systematic market research we could probably save ourselves a few dollars, but we would have to repeat the process every few months to keep up with the market. Faced with this proliferation of choice, most consumers just feel confused. If anyone actually behaved in this ‘rational’ way we would think they needed to get a life. (https://www.notion.so/Buying-products-we-are-forced-to-choose-and-to-wrestle-with-a-suspicion-that-we-are-probably-being--f8597e4e7ad348628527312d68ecfeb6?pvs=21), If you think what Pavlov did, he actually took a neutral object and, by associating it with a meaningful object, made it a symbol of something else; Advertisers persistently link margarine with images of happy families, healthy children and ‘quality time’. Breakfasts are made, kids jump on parents’ beds, and the sun streams through the windows. The approach works because it is the emotion, not the margarine, that is being sold. Ads for cars rarely show more than one car on the road at a time. In defiance of the realiry of being stuck in a traffic jam, cars are often sold as symbols of freedom - the freedom to go wherever you want, whenever you want and usually, on the ads at least, as fast as you want. (https://www.notion.so/If-you-think-what-Pavlov-did-he-actually-took-a-neutral-object-and-by-associating-it-with-a-meanin-84aa835791d1417581b302c2c8f46f8c?pvs=21), One of the striking tendencies of human beings is to act, judge, believe or vote on strictly instinctive, emotional grounds, and then, after the act is committed, to try to justify or defend it by intellectual or logical reasons. Advertisers have become adept at playing to the heart while providing excuses for the head. (https://www.notion.so/One-of-the-striking-tendencies-of-human-beings-is-to-act-judge-believe-or-vote-on-strictly-instinc-80c553b7fe3c43bd961198b468e7cbc2?pvs=21), Our marketing culture has done something profound right under our noses: it has redefined happiness itself. In place of the time-honoured belief that a happy life is one of fulfilment acquired through developing our capacities, cultivating personal relatinnships and adhering to a moral code, people today have been persuaded that a happy life is one in which we maximise the number of episodes of emotional and physical pleasure, however fleeting they might be. (https://www.notion.so/Our-marketing-culture-has-done-something-profound-right-under-our-noses-it-has-redefined-happiness--7eb48316ecb243d2851737d03a52bd59?pvs=21), Modern marketers often aim their advertising at children in the belief that the children will then play on their parents’ weaknesses and cajole them into selling children’s products: it is also designed to sell adult goods - including cars, home appliances and holidays. Juliet Schor, one of the most vocal critics of the US advertising industry’s increasing focus on children, argues that marketers see children not just as a lucrative demographic but also as the weakest link in the defences families build up to protect themselves against marketing. (https://www.notion.so/Modern-marketers-often-aim-their-advertising-at-children-in-the-belief-that-the-children-will-then-p-db9a33a4847b4066a05985eec94dca64?pvs=21), A subsequent advertisement showed close-ups of children playing in the ‘dirty’ backyard, touching, among other things, a tennis ball that had been in a dog’s mouth. A naive viewer might think this is an appeal to anxious parents, but the object is actually to create anxious children. Fear is instilled in the children, and they are then provided with the argument they need to convince their parents to buy a particular product. (https://www.notion.so/A-subsequent-advertisement-showed-close-ups-of-children-playing-in-the-dirty-backyard-touching-a-16fff11f46b54d36a43fe8d6c5edd851?pvs=21), The kids decide what’s cool, and parents don’t want to seem out of touch, so they listen. Sometimes, the child literally is our customer. I have watched the child pick out the car. And I have seen people go from a Taurus to an Explorer in the blink of an eye because the kid didn’t want to be seen in a station wagon. One industry estimate has it that 67 per cent of parents car purchases are influenced by children. (https://www.notion.so/The-kids-decide-what-s-cool-and-parents-don-t-want-to-seem-out-of-touch-so-they-listen-Sometimes--b6c0a3e8e8d343fbbecb6d1e98222eff?pvs=21), Advertising at its best is making people feel that, without their product, you’re a loser. Kids are very sensitive to that. If you tell them to buy something, they are resistant. But if you tell them they’II be a dork if they don’t, you’ve got their attention. You open up emotional vulnerabilities, and it’s easy to do with kids because they’re the most vulnerable.

The teens and early twenties are periods of intense psychological stress, restlessness and boredom. Many socially awkward situations are encountered. The minute or two required to stop and light a cigarette, ask for a light, find an ash tray, and the like provide something to do during periods of awkwardness and boredom.

But, to create a desire for a cool new product, the marketer must first engender discontent among the children who do not have the latest toy, sports shoe or breakfast cereal.

Celebrity appears to be the opposite of what tweens fear most - rejection and social isolation. To gain acceptance they will go to extreme lengths.

Breaking the link is a vital stage in the therapeutic process, although in order to do it the therapist must dissolve a deeper association - between the acquisition of goods and a sense of self-worth, which is preciseiy the association advertisers labour to create.

This was made spectacularly clear during the ideologues, the state rushed in to shore up the banking system. (https://www.notion.so/Neoliberalism-surreptitiously-relied-on-the-state-even-while-it-has-ideologically-excoriated-it-Thi-773bd6b637b24a2d879532556f78233a?pvs=21), The new defines itself in response to what is already established; at the same time, the established has to reconfigure itself in response to the new. Tradition counts for nothing when it is no longer contested and modified. A culture that is merely preserved is no culture at all.

To justify their conservatism, the partisans of the established order cannot really call it ideal or wonderful. So instead, they have decided to say that all the rest is horrible. Sure, they say, we may not live in a condition of perfect Goodness. But we’re lucky that we don’t live in a condition of Evil. Our democracy is not perfect. But it’s better than the bloody dictatorships. Capitalism is unjust. But it’s not criminal like Stalinism. We let miIJions of Africans die of AIDS, but we don’t make racist nationalist declarations like Milosevic. We kill Iraqis with our airplanes, but we don’t cut their throats with machetes like they do in Rwanda, etc. The ‘realism’ here is analogous to the deflationary perspective of a depressive who believes that any positive state, any hope, is a dangerous illusion.

This makes capitalism very much like the Thing in John Carpenter’s film of the same name: a monstrous, infinitely plastic entity, capable of metabolizing and absorbing anything with which it comes into contact. (https://www.notion.so/The-limits-of-capitalism-are-not-fixed-by-fiat-but-defined-and-re-defined-pragmatically-and-impro-31e86ac46500404d8506267b4021080f?pvs=21), For most people under twenty in Europe and North America, the lack of alternatives to capitalism is no longer even an issue. Capitalism seamlessly occupies the horizons of the thinkable. (https://www.notion.so/For-most-people-under-twenty-in-Europe-and-North-America-the-lack-of-alternatives-to-capitalism-is--0a7e3b354a7d40bd83b51dd3ffa7ab60?pvs=21), ‘Real’ means the death of the social: it means corporations who respond to increased profits not by raising pay or improving benefits but by downsizing (the laying-off the permanent workforce in order to create a floating employment pool of part-time and freelance workers without benefits or job security). (https://www.notion.so/Real-means-the-death-of-the-social-it-means-corporations-who-respond-to-increased-profits-not-by-r-9995cafecc744c7c8c915dc7fa4ead20?pvs=21), The affinity between hip hop and gangster movies such as Scarface, The Godfather films, Reservoir Dogs, Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction arises from their common claim to have stripped the world of sentimental illusions and seen it for ‘what it really is’:  a Hobbesian war of all against all, a system of perpetual exploitation and generalized criminality. In hip hop, Reynolds writes, ‘To “get real” is to confront a state-of-nature where dog eats dog, where you’re either a winner or a loser, and where most will be losers’.  (https://www.notion.so/The-affinity-between-hip-hop-and-gangster-movies-such-as-Scarface-The-Godfather-films-Reservoir-Do-0e348529ad9f467ab5e6e07a365d5106?pvs=21), Capitalist realism is like a pervasive atmosphere, conditioning not only the production of culture but also the regulation of work and education, and acting as a kind of invisible barrier constraining thought and action. A moral critique of capitalism, emphasizing the ways in which it leads to suffering, only reinforces capitalist realism. Poverty, famine and war can be presented as an inevitable part of reality, while the hope that these forms of suffering could be eliminated easily painted as naive utopianism. Capitalist realism can only be threatened if it is shown to be in some way inconsistent or untenable. (https://www.notion.so/Capitalist-realism-is-like-a-pervasive-atmosphere-conditioning-not-only-the-production-of-culture-b-48341ccd81f84187922fb8777e2162db?pvs=21), The significance of Green critiques is that they suggest that, far from being the only viable political-economic system, capitalism is in fact primed to destroy the entire human environment. Capital’s “need of a constantly expanding market”, its “growth fetish”, mean that capitalism is by its very nature opposed to any notion of sustainability.

The ‘mental health plague’ in capitalist societies would suggest that, instead of being the only social system that works, capitalism is inherently dysfunctional, and that the cost of it appearing to work is very high.

But that ‘knowledge’, that reflexivity, is not a passive observation of an already existing state of affairs. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Many of the teenage students I encountered seemed to be in a state of what I would call “depressive hedonia”. Depression is usually characterized as a state of anhedonia, but the condition I’m referring to is constituted not by an inability to get pleasure so much as it by an inability to do anything else except pursue pleasure. (https://www.notion.so/It-is-not-an-exaggeration-to-say-that-being-a-teenager-in-late-capitalist-Britain-is-now-close-to-be-f04fa8a7d6ec40f3aa906175648bcf5c?pvs=21), There is a sense that ‘something is missing’ - but no appreciation that this mysterious, missing enjoyment can only be accessed beyond the pleasure principle. (https://www.notion.so/There-is-a-sense-that-something-is-missing-but-no-appreciation-that-this-mysterious-missing-enj-7fa6fa94f714445b86ef854a45203e98?pvs=21), Ask students to read for more than a couple of sentences and many - and these are A-Ievel students mind you -  will protest that they can’t do it. The most frequent complaint teachers hear is that it’s boring. It is not so much the content of the writteng material that is at issue here; it is the act of reading itself that is deemed to be “boring”. To be bored simply means to be removed from the communicative sensation-stimulus matrix of texting, YouTube and fast food; to be denied, for a moment, the constant flow of sugary gratification on demand. (https://www.notion.so/Ask-students-to-read-for-more-than-a-couple-of-sentences-and-many-and-these-are-A-Ievel-students-m-b91788803db34da389458fba09726f41?pvs=21), “Writing has never beer capitalism’s thing. Capitalism is profoundly illiterate.” Deleuze and Guattari argued in Anti-Oedipus. (https://www.notion.so/Writing-has-never-beer-capitalism-s-thing-Capitalism-is-profoundly-illiterate-Deleuze-and-Guattar-5b3d7b812c014648a3ad0a40637aa0a9?pvs=21), With families buckling under the pressure of a capitalism which requires both parents to work, teachers are now increasingly required to act as surrogate parents, instilling the most basic behavioral protocols in students and providing pastoral and emotional support for teenagers who are in some cases only minimally socialized. (https://www.notion.so/With-families-buckling-under-the-pressure-of-a-capitalism-which-requires-both-parents-to-work-teach-40dda011abde489194adbfc77d112477?pvs=21), Deleuze says tha Control societies are based on debt rather than enclosure; but there is a way in which the current education system both indebts and encloses students. Pay for your own exploitation, the Iogic insists - get into debt so you can get the same McJob you could have walked into if you'd left school at sixteen.. (https://www.notion.so/Deleuze-says-tha-Control-societies-are-based-on-debt-rather-than-enclosure-but-there-is-a-way-in-wh-fdafc3bea9fa4d2db641b61ae929e46b?pvs=21), So called ‘liberal communists’ such as George Soros and Bill Gates who combine rapacious pursuit of profit with the rhetoric of ecological concern and social responsibility are far from constituting any kind of progressive corrective to official capitalist ideology. Liberal communism constitutes the dominan ideology of capitalism now. ‘Flexibility’, ‘nomadism’, and ‘spontaneity’ are the very hallmarks of management in a post Fordist, Control society. (https://www.notion.so/So-called-liberal-communists-such-as-George-Soros-and-Bill-Gates-who-combine-rapacious-pursuit-of--ac0ef2ffe1374c24af4ae3ce3cfe8666?pvs=21), Harvey demonstrates that, in an era popularly described as ‘post-political’, class war has continued to be fought, but only by one side: the wealthy. As Harvey shows, neoliberals were more Leninist than the Leninists, using think-tanks as the intellectual vanguard to create the ideological climate in which capitalist realism could flourish. (https://www.notion.so/Harvey-demonstrates-that-in-an-era-popularly-described-as-post-political-class-war-has-continued-4979542f82d646bbb51e95c6b5afc5f2?pvs=21), Crime boss Neil Mcaluey in the movie Heat - ‘Don’t let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner’. Like any group of shareholders, McCauley’s crew is held together by the prospect of future revenue; any other bonds are optional extras, almost certainly dangerous. Their arrangement is temporary, pragmatic and lateral -  they know that they are interchangeable machine parts, that there are no guarantees, that nothing lasts. Compared to this, the goodfellas seem like sedentary sentimentalists, rooted in dying communities, doomed territories. (https://www.notion.so/Crime-boss-Neil-Mcaluey-in-the-movie-Heat-Don-t-let-yourself-get-attached-to-anything-you-are-not-cb204ba15bbc4746a99f536e5e99fd39?pvs=21), Where formerly workers could acquire a single set of skills and expect to progress upwards through a rigid organizational hierarchy, now they are required to periodically re-skill as they move from institution to institution, from role to role. As the organization of work is decentralized, with lateral networks replacing pyramidal hierarchies, a premium is put on ‘flexibility’. Echoing McCauley’s mockery of Hanna in Heat (’How do you expect to keep a marriage?’), Sennett emphasizes the intolerable stresses that these conditions of permanent instability put on family life.

It consists of arranging and rearranging the assignment of rewards and punishments in such a faship as to make the probability of some choices much higher, and of some others much lower, than they otherwise would have been. “Reality”, after all, is the name we give to external resistance to our own inner wishes... The stronger their resistance, the more “real” the obstacles feel.

Most of them believed that such a sum total could be calculated - and once the productive capacity of society matched it, the “stable” or “steady” economy, more akin and friendly to the “natural” disposition of human beings, would follow.

People can only be this individualistic when they are unencumbered by loyalties to their family, friends, traditional obligations, customs, trade unions, or guilds.

Traditional sources of psychosocial integration in every type of society came to be identified as “market distoritions” that had to be eliminated.

He argued that human beings are not only powerfully drawn to the company of their own community by the social instinct, but are also innately inclined to feel “sympathy” for them, and innately predisposed towards cooperative behaviour and selfless sacrafice within their tribal societies. He called this predisposition the “moral sense” (https://www.notion.so/In-The-Descent-of-Man-Darwin-described-the-innate-drive-towards-social-contact-which-he-called-th-b1d7e731f9154da5885b3cbe712365e7?pvs=21), Darwin didn’t see the social instinct and the moral sense as mechanical drives or blind reflexes, but as deeply felt human needs that gave people great pleasure when they were satisfied (https://www.notion.so/Darwin-didn-t-see-the-social-instinct-and-the-moral-sense-as-mechanical-drives-or-blind-reflexes-bu-40cf5386bc5a4e2eac15f631547743bc?pvs=21), A man looks forwards and backwards, and compares his various feelings, desires, and recollections. He then finds, in accordance with the verdict of all the wisest man that the highest satisfaction is derived from following certain impulses, namely the social instincts.

As a solitary being, he attempts to protect his own existance, to satisfy his personal desires, and to develop his innate abilities.

In the late 1800s, a strong countermovement of British working-class unions and humanitatians within the middle and upper classes finally gained real power and the cruelties of free-marketisation were reduced in Great Britain itself. However, they continued to increase around the globe (https://www.notion.so/The-necessary-connection-between-the-new-economics-and-human-misery-was-recognised-both-by-intellect-514ac4348d314646a59b968642aef9d8?pvs=21), Increasing British economic and military power hastened the growth of free-market society in continental Europe, where its spread was enthusiastically accelerated in France by Napoleon I and his successors after the revolution of 1789. It was impossible to stand up to the British without adopting the economic system that was the foundation of their economic and military strength. There was no resisting the spread of free-market economics. As A. C. Bayly put it, “The elaborate system of commercial and trade regulation of the eighteenth century was abolished by consent in northwestern Europe”. In the 21st century, globalisation was slowed by two world wars, an economic depression, and a ‘cold war’. However, it regained full stride with the collapse of the Soviet Union and raced into the 21st century.

Clan chiefs who retained land were admitted into English society, but only if they transformed themselves from Gaelic-speaking chiefs to English-speaking landlords. The free market took up the work of cultural destruction where the military left off. At the same time that the Scottish landlords were losing their traditional status in highland society, they learned to covet the prestige that the export market could bring: homes in London, city wives with worldly repartee and decolletage, English peerages, continental food and art.

It became evident that either the free market was to be thwarted by highland tradition or the highlanders had to be evicted. The evictions that ensued were so vast in scope that they became known as ’clearances’. Legal eviction notices procured by former clan chiefs or imported landlords usually allowed highland families a few months to voluntarily pull down their houses and leave. Many refused and saw their homes burnt to the ground by the sheriff.

These principles included wholesale privatisation of government enterprises, whether they were functioning efficiently or not; removal of tariff protections for industry, including industries that were vital for local employment and stability; elimination of food subsidies for the poor, even when mass starvation was the foreseeable result; stripping countries of the political power to protect their own economies, thus leaving them at the mercy of “market forces”; forcing elementary schools to collect ‘cost recovery’ fees, even when it meant that huge numbers of children could not attend; closing local banks or subjecting them to ruinous competition by foreign banks; and forcing balanced budgets on governments at all points in their economic cycles.

This campaign is explicitly justified on the ground that the European welfare state “perturbs” the workings of the free market in labour. Detailed examination of the changes that are being made reveals that they lead not only to material poverty for the unemployed, but also to loss of security and social identity in mainstream society - in other words, dislocation.

For rich and poor alike, in great cities and small towns, people’s jobs disappear at short notice; life-long employees’ pensions disappear; families and communities live with financial uncertainty; people routinely change neighbourhoods, occupations, co-workers. technical skills, status, reference groups, languages, nationalities, priests, therapists, spiritual beliefs, and ideologies as their lives progress.

European people, for example, could identify themselves as members of the Church of Rome, or followers of a Protestant sect, or citizens of a powerful nation, or respected authorities in their field of knowledge, or part of the intellectual community, or strong fathers or nurturing mothers, or members of a proud race, or any combination of these. By contrast, post-modernity is a ‘desymbolised’ environment, in which the symbolic potency of religion, nationality, intellectual achievement, authority, gender, and race must be discredited in order to make people maximally responsive to a continually changing economy. People must be flexible workers and trendy consumers with all theiI options open.

I think it is observable in a whole parade of changes, not all yet well understood, that are affecting the populations of the developed countries. These are familiar changes: preoccupation with merchandise, difficulties of self-concept and socialisation, drug addiction, hyperactivity and the appearance of what are called, rightly or wrongly, ”the new symptoms”.

Cutting-edgers have no interest in ideals, ethics or societal issues or any belief that their participation in politics or civic life would make any difference. These are not the activist antiglobalisation disciples of Naomi Klein, but rather the apolitical crew of the Starship Enterprise. They are non-ideological and non-judgmental. They see nothing worth fighting for, no belief system, no country, no tribe. Life for them is an unending exploration of all the micropleasures the world has to offer them.

Hire somebody off the street to be a waiter at a fancy restaurant. They will become a waiter and act like a total prick to the people who walk into the restaurant. People that are likely exactly like them. People who might even be their friends. And the waiter will look down his nose at those people like they’re not good enough to be served in the joint.

It is the need for an authority figure. He will serve as a point of order in her otherwise volatile life. He makes decisions for the ho. This doesn’t mean she doesn’t know how to do shit for herself, but a ho lives in a world of uncertainty. Most of the uncertainties a ho has are packed away in her fucked up childhood. Pimp Law is a certainty and, for whatever the fuck Pimp Law turns out to be in practice its chief function is as an injunction. It is firm. This doesn’t mean that when he tells her to do certain shit, or he beats her for some shit, that it’s right, but somewhere, deep down in the ho, she wants it, she needs it.

The result was a prepackaged system, abstracted from reality, commodified, and sold back to the street. In the wake of this cultural movement was founded a self-perpetuating system based on the fetishized image that, in its fixity, proved to be its very motive force. The Game became codified as is apparent in the pimp, his clothes, cars, and behavior. Where practices may have varied before, now there were common expectations established through a common understanding of what it meant to be in the Game.

This means a ho has got to give up her cash to her pimp, she needs to buy into his game.

These ho-movies, as I will now call them are almost invariably about money, power, and respect. The ho sees the status of her pimp as a reflection of her own. As she continues to work in the present, her eye is on the future when they’ll (she and her pimp) will be made. Salvation is not only to be had, but a sense of social vengeance is also to be satisfied. In the ho-movie, she expects to, at a later date, sneer down on a contemptible and cold bourgeois society from a position both above and outside. Her sweeping glance from this Olympian height takes in both those that she shared either bedroom or elbowroom with as well as those that she feels have rejected her. It’s actually pretty sick and inevitably doomed to failure.

You see, if the movie is too good, she’ll run scared. So you’ve got to make sure the movie loops as well with no actual ending. Repetition is key. The ho can only circle around what could be considered happiness, as true happiness wouId be the end.

There, in turn, I told her that she was too good for all those bitches. And I used the restaurant for some kind of analogy saying, There’re plenty of fish in the sea, justlike on this menu, but if you swim with Trippple Beam, we’ll school those fish. I’ll always have the claws, and you’ll have the tail.

I kept taking her out to fancy places, I bought her all new shit. She still needed the medication, so Betty and l went down the drug store and we picked up her prescription. Shit was expensive, but I paid for it and told her she didn’t need to worry, that I am looking after her now. Betty and I stayed holed up in that motel for three weeks. She came to depend on me for everything. I kept buying her what she needed and taking her out to eat, but, in the middle of the third week, I started playing it like we were almost out of money. She started getting panicky, and she kept asking me what we were going to do. I told her not to worry. She loved Trippple Beam, and why not. I was doing all kinds of shit for her nobody else ever had. It went on like this, but at the end of the two weeks, I changed gears on her again. …A couple of days past the time to pay money back. We hadn’t really left the motel, as though danger Iurked at every corner. Having created an atmosphere of fear, it was time to lay a head trip on her.

Let’s just go up there and you can check it out. No harm in that, right? I think that in the end it was curiosity that played a big role. I made it all out like there was no commitment, she could just case the scene. Get her there, get her talking to some tricks like it’s all some kind some kind of game. She’ll be thinking she’s there just to check it out, like it’s a social experiment or whatever, but that’s not what’s really going to go down.

First of all this cements the entrance into voluntary agreement. But unlike where the exchange of money serves to neutralise the relationship for the ho beyond service rendered with the trick, by paying the pimp, the ho has to keep working. The right for the ho to bask in the glory of Cock is not freely given, but must be earned. It is what keeps the pimp fixed firmly in his position as pimp while allowing her to keep the ho-movie running in her head. In this way the pimp doesn’t fall to the wayside like a trick, and the necessary distance between himself and the ho is maintained. (https://www.notion.so/There-are-a-couple-reason-why-a-pimp-needs-the-money-before-he-ll-fuck-her-First-of-all-this-cement-604ea19a9dad4c85ae44c565d8fb9ea1?pvs=21), I’d try and create a sense of my all-seeing-eye, so that hoes would feel they are always being watched. I’d lie to them about the CCTV feeds. But what I realized is that this was all unnecessary. When you win a ho over, and shove her full of Cock, she becomes a cheerful little robot. With Cock ensconced in her brain, she will self-police, seein the pimp forever in her mind’s eye.

(https://www.notion.so/Reality-is-created-by-the-act-of-willing-it-is-the-stubborn-indifference-of-the-world-to-my-intent-c359fc02945345648c982b9ed3b8e70e?pvs=21), Feeling free from constaint, free to act on one’s wishes, means reaching a balance between the wishes, the imagination, and the ability to act: one feels free so far as the imagination is not greater than one’s actual desires, while neither of the two reaches beyond the ability to act. When the balance is achieved “liberation” is a meaningless slogan, lacking motivational force. (https://www.notion.so/Feeling-free-from-constaint-free-to-act-on-one-s-wishes-means-reaching-a-balance-between-the-wishe-3d467d52810b4ffa9f39c0c96b263ced?pvs=21), Through the direct manipulation on the intentions - some sort of “brainwashing” - one could never put the “objective” ability to act to the test, let alone find out what they really are, and therefore would set the ambitions below the level of the “objective” freedom. One such issue was the possibility that what feels like freedom is not in fact freedom at all; that people may be satisfied with their lot even though that lot were far from being “objectively” satisfactory; that, living in the slavery, they feel free and so experience no urge to liberate themselves, thus forsaking of forfeiting the chance of becoming genuinely free. (https://www.notion.so/Through-the-direct-manipulation-on-the-intentions-some-sort-of-brainwashing-one-could-never-pu-934683e36bd8453da9e3829eb9c432dc?pvs=21), Elpenoros (a sailor turned into a hog) said to Oddyseus after he turned him back to human form: “I was so happy, I could wallow in the mud and bask in the sunshine, I could gobble and guzzle, grunt and squeak, and be free from meditations and doubts: ‘what am I to do, this or that?’ Why did you come?! To fling me back into that hateful life I led before?” (https://www.notion.so/Elpenoros-a-sailor-turned-into-a-hog-said-to-Oddyseus-after-he-turned-him-back-to-human-form-I-w-a4fd729b784d44cabbeff4c1783a6bbd?pvs=21), “mass culture” - a collective brain-damage caused by a “culture industry” planting a thirst for entertainment and amusement in the place which - as Matthew Arnold would say - should be occupied by “the passion for sweetness and light and the passion for making them prevail” (https://www.notion.so/mass-culture-a-collective-brain-damage-caused-by-a-culture-industry-planting-a-thirst-for-enter-a7791a0864024264a3790155e96a9318?pvs=21), Neoliberal definition of fulfillment says: “What filled an event with satisfaction is that YOU did it. With a substantial responsibility resting on YOUR shoulders. With a substantial amount of the good thing being YOUR contribution”. But “being thrown on one’s own resources” augurs mental torments and the agony of indecision, while “responsibility resing on one’s own shoulders” portends a paralysing fear of risk and failure without the right to appeal and seek redress. This cannot be what “freedom” really means. (https://www.notion.so/Neoliberal-definition-of-fulfillment-says-What-filled-an-event-with-satisfaction-is-that-YOU-did-i-4b6e1bd6edbc4baab43a5bb0990f7b06?pvs=21), The old controversy between Adam Smith and Dennis Diderot: While Smith warned against the degrading and stulityfying effects of working routine, Diderot did not believe routine work is degrading.

This is a kind of society which no longer recognizes any alternative to itself and thereby feels absolved from the duty to examine, demonstrate, justify (let alone prove) the validity of its outspoken and tacit assumptions. (https://www.notion.so/The-society-stopped-questioning-itself-This-is-a-kind-of-society-which-no-longer-recognizes-any-alt-73002311e8d84d02b0aa67b85e0bfb92?pvs=21), We are perhaps more “critically predisposed”, much bolder and instransigent in our criticism than our ancestors managed to be in their daily lives, but our critique, so to speak, is “toothless”, unable to affect the agenda set for our “life-political” choices. The unprecedented freedom which our society offers its members has arrived, as Leo Strauss warned a long while ago, together with unprecedented impotence. (https://www.notion.so/We-are-perhaps-more-critically-predisposed-much-bolder-and-instransigent-in-our-criticism-than-ou-5dfa132c814644308fe65face888928f?pvs=21), George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-four was, at the time it was written, the fullest - and canonical - inventory of the fears and apprehensions which haunted modernity in its heavy stage (totalitarism).  (https://www.notion.so/George-Orwell-s-Nineteen-Eighty-four-was-at-the-time-it-was-written-the-fullest-and-canonical--407e3389778b4f66b75f0b4ec15c949a?pvs=21), One sometimes hears the opinion that contemporary society is inhospitable to critique. That opinion seems to miss the nature of the present change by assuming that the meaning of ‘hospitality’ itself stays invariant over successive historical phases. The point is, however, that contemporary society has given to the ‘hospitality to critique’ an entirely new sense and has invented a way to accommodate critical thought and action while remaining immune to the consequences of that accommodation, and so emerging unaffected and unscathed - reinforced rather than weakened - from the tests and trials of the open-house policy.  (https://www.notion.so/One-sometimes-hears-the-opinion-that-contemporary-society-is-inhospitable-to-critique-That-opinion--d7c0d09659c7496785248f2f89409632?pvs=21), Again in retrospect, we can say that critical theory was aimed at defusing and neutralizing, preferably turning off altogether, the totalitarian tendency of a society presumed to be burdened with totalistic proclivities endemically and permanently. Defending human autonomy, freedom of choice and self-assertion and the right to be and stay different was critical theory’s principal objective. (https://www.notion.so/Again-in-retrospect-we-can-say-that-critical-theory-was-aimed-at-defusing-and-neutralizing-prefera-44e0990f4d1245788061fb40cf0e4282?pvs=21), Being modern came to mean, as it means today, being unable to stop and even less able to stand still. We move and are bound to keep moving because of the impossibility of ever being gratified: the horizon of satisfaction, the finishing line of effort and the moment of restful self-congratulation move faster than the fastest of the runners. Fulfilment is always in the future, and achievement lose their attraction and satisfying potential at the moment of the attainment, if not before. Being modern means being perpetually ahead of oneself, in a state of constant transgression. One cannot be Mensch without being, or at least struggling be, Ubermensch. It also means having an identity which can exist only as an unfulfilled project. (https://www.notion.so/Being-modern-came-to-mean-as-it-means-today-being-unable-to-stop-and-even-less-able-to-stand-still-a87f2f7670664e3baa888adb59aef6b2?pvs=21), What used to be considered a job to be performed by human reason seen as the collective endowment and property of the human species has been fragmented ‘individualized’, assigned to individual guts and stamina, and left to individuals’ management and individually administered resources. This fateful departure has been reflected in the relocation of ethical/political discourse from the frame of the ‘just society’ to that of ‘human rights’, that is refocusing that discourse on the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life-style.  (https://www.notion.so/What-used-to-be-considered-a-job-to-be-performed-by-human-reason-seen-as-the-collective-endowment-an-240607607c704b93bb9fa1d00e506a6e?pvs=21), “No more salvation by society”, famously proclaimed the apostle of the new business spirit, Peter Drucker. “There is no such thing as society”, declared Margaret Thatcher yet more bluntly. Don’t look back, or up; look inside yourself, where your own cunning, will and power - all the tools that life’s improvement may require - are supposed to reside. (https://www.notion.so/No-more-salvation-by-society-famously-proclaimed-the-apostle-of-the-new-business-spirit-Peter-Dru-56b1267f55ef4f3b869a0e62e3cc7317?pvs=21), Modern society exists in its incessant activity of ‘individualizing’ as much as the activities of individuals consist in the daily reshaping and renegotiating of the network of mutual entanglements called ‘society’ Neither of the two partners stays put for long. And so the meaning of ‘individualization’ keeps changing, taking up ever new shapes - as the accumulated results of past history undermine inherited rules, set new behavioural precepts and turn out ever new stakes of the game. (https://www.notion.so/Modern-society-exists-in-its-incessant-activity-of-individualizing-as-much-as-the-activities-of-in-78309d492fd34185aa964b9c21a17322?pvs=21), ‘individualization’ consists of transforming human ‘identity’ from a ‘given’ into a ‘task’ and charging the actors with the responsibility for performing that task and for the consequences (also the side-effects) of their performance. Humans are no more ‘born into’ their identities. (The same cannot be said about princes or serfs of the pre-modern era; neither about the hereditary rich and hereditary poor of modern times.) Needing to become what one is - is the feature of modern living. (https://www.notion.so/individualization-consists-of-transforming-human-identity-from-a-given-into-a-task-and-chargi-75b3a90143e343a6bc7a3451fc46873e?pvs=21), It can be said in retrospect that the class division (or gender division for that matter) was a by-product of unequal access to resources required to render the self-assertion effective. People endowed with fewer resources, and thus with less choice, had to compensate for their individual weaknesses by the ‘power of numbers’ - by closing ranks and engaging in collective action. As Claus Offe pointed out, collective, class-oriented action came to those lower down the social ladder as naturally and matter-of-factly as the individual pursuit of their life-goals came to their employers. The deprivations ‘added up’, so to speak; and having added up, they congealed in ‘common interests’ and were seen as amenable solely to a collective remedy. (https://www.notion.so/It-can-be-said-in-retrospect-that-the-class-division-or-gender-division-for-that-matter-was-a-by-p-25d11d14f9e7416b92540611b926f361?pvs=21), The individual’s self-containment and self-sufficiency may be another illusion: that men and women have no one to blame for their frustrations and troubles does not mean, they can protect themselves against frustration using their own domestic appliances or pull themselves out of trouble. And yet, if they fall ill, it is assumed that this has happened because they were not resolute and industrious enough in following their health regime; if they stay unemployed, it is because they failed to learn the skills of gaining an interview, or because they did not try hard enough to find a job or because they are, purely and simply, work-shy; if they are not sure about their career prospects and agonize about their future, it is because they are not good enough at winning friends and influencing people and failed to learn and master, as they should have done, the arts of self-expression and impressing others. (https://www.notion.so/The-individual-s-self-containment-and-self-sufficiency-may-be-another-illusion-that-men-and-women-h-9f43362423af4779bf42b6025ed941af?pvs=21), Risks and contradictions go on being socially produced; it is just the duty and the necessity to cope with them which are being individualized.  (https://www.notion.so/Risks-and-contradictions-go-on-being-socially-produced-it-is-just-the-duty-and-the-necessity-to-cop-af6aecdf2b6c4466a168cfba6729f704?pvs=21), The sole advantage the company of other sufferers may bring is to reassure each one that fighting the troubles alone is what all the others do daily - and so to refresh and boost once more the flagging resolve to go on doing just that. One may perhaps also learn from other people’s experience how to survive the next round of ‘downsizing’, how to handle children who think they are adolescents and adolescents who refuse to become adults, how to get the fat and other unwelcome ‘foreign bodies’ ‘out of one’s system’, how to get rid addiction that is no longer pleasurable or partners who are no longer satisfying. But what one learns in the first place from the company of others is that the only service companies can render is advice about how to survive in one’s own irredeemable loneliness, and that everyone’s life is full of risks which need to be confronted and fought alone.  (https://www.notion.so/The-sole-advantage-the-company-of-other-sufferers-may-bring-is-to-reassure-each-one-that-fighting-th-919b188cf6f0491f9bc3fc349da6fc7c?pvs=21), Setting people free may make them indifferent. The individual is the citizen’s worst enemy, de Tocqueville suggested. The ‘citizen’ is a person inclined to seek her or his own welfare through the well-being of the city - while the individual tends to be lukewarm, sceptical or wary about ‘common cause’, ‘common good’, ‘good society’ or ‘just society’. Whatever individuals may do when they come together, and whatever other benefits their shared labours may bring, portends constraint on their freedom to pursue what they see fit for each separately, and will not help such pursuit anyway. (https://www.notion.so/Setting-people-free-may-make-them-indifferent-The-individual-is-the-citizen-s-worst-enemy-de-Tocqu-5eec3a5d3138409a9d10846ecaded89a?pvs=21), ‘Vigilance is degraded to the surveillance of goods, while general inrerest is no more than a syndicate of egoisms, engaging collective emotions and fear of the neighbour.’ Joel Roman urges the readers to seek the ‘renewed capacity for deciding together’ - now salient mostly for its absence. (https://www.notion.so/Vigilance-is-degraded-to-the-surveillance-of-goods-while-general-inrerest-is-no-more-than-a-syndica-313b0e1fe168472499008392cde9358c?pvs=21), The ‘public’ is colonized by the ‘private’. ‘public interest’ is not anymore the search for common causes and for the ways to negotiate the meaning of the common good and the principles of life in common. Instead it is reduced to curiosity about the private lives of public figures and the art of public life is narrowed to the public display of private affairs and public confessions of private sentiments (the more intimate the better). ‘Public issues’ which resist such reduction become all but incomprehensible. (https://www.notion.so/The-public-is-colonized-by-the-private-public-interest-is-not-anymore-the-search-for-common-c-f12673effdad4feba90d718bc214a912?pvs=21), Sharing intimacies, as Richard Sennett keeps pointing out, tends to be the preferred, perhaps the only remaining, method of ‘community building’. This building technique can only spawn ‘communities’ as fragile and short-lived as scattered and wandering emotions, shifting erratically from one target to another and drifting in the forever inconclusive search for a secure haven: communities of shared worries, shared anxieties or shared hatreds - but in each case ‘peg’ communities, a momentary gathering around a nail on which many solitary individuals hang their solitary individual fears. (https://www.notion.so/Sharing-intimacies-as-Richard-Sennett-keeps-pointing-out-tends-to-be-the-preferred-perhaps-the-on-7e9dceb6c5534ff3878714e6297d860d?pvs=21), Individualization brings to the ever-growing number of men and women an unprecedented freedom of experimenting - but it also brings the unprecedented task of coping with their consequences. The yawning gap between the right of self-assertion and the capacity to control the social settings which render such self-assertion feasible or unrealistic seems to be the main contradiction of fluid modernity. (https://www.notion.so/Individualization-brings-to-the-ever-growing-number-of-men-and-women-an-unprecedented-freedom-of-exp-e866706a35ac497197a706c6f008da45?pvs=21), Being an individual “de jure” means having no one to blame for one’s own misery, seeking the causes of one’s own defeats nowhere except in one’s own indolence and sloth, and looking for no remedies other than trying harder and harder still. Living daily with the risk of self-reprobation and self-contempt is not an easy matter. With the eyes focused on their own performances and thus diverted from the social space where the contradictions of individual existence are collectively produced, men and women are naturally tempted to reduce the complexity of their predicament in order to render the causes of misery intelligible and so tractable and amenable to remedial action. Not that they find ‘biographic solutions’ onerous and cumbersome: there are, simply, no effective ‘biographic solutions to systemic contradictions’, and so the dearth of workable solutions at their disposal needs to be compensated for by imaginary ones.

(https://www.notion.so/The-great-humanistic-and-historical-task-of-the-oppressed-is-to-liberate-themselves-and-their-oppres-38e3f2be547541649b9a5f5b940a54d6?pvs=21), Any attempt to “soften” the power of the oppressor in deference to the weakness of the oppressed almost always manifests itself in the form of false generosity;  (https://www.notion.so/Any-attempt-to-soften-the-power-of-the-oppressor-in-deference-to-the-weakness-of-the-oppressed-alm-c30397a3621b44a884cced482361133f?pvs=21), The oppressors, who oppress, exploit, and rape by virtue of their power, cannot find in this power the strength to liberate either the oppressed or themselves. Only power that springs from the weakness of the oppressed will be sufficiently strong to free both.  (https://www.notion.so/The-oppressors-who-oppress-exploit-and-rape-by-virtue-of-their-power-cannot-find-in-this-power-t-08b76d76d5434e7898a75e1c8f0d2f64?pvs=21), In order to have the continued opportunity to express their “generosity,” the oppressors must perpetuate injustice as well. An unjust social order is the permanent fount of this “generosity,” which is nourished by death, despair, and poverty. True generosity consists precisely in fighting to destroy the causes which nourish false charity. (https://www.notion.so/In-order-to-have-the-continued-opportunity-to-express-their-generosity-the-oppressors-must-perpet-436e8b85f68a43219b3d1d338f9d00d2?pvs=21), Oppressed must oppose the oppressors by an act of love. They must oppose the lovelessness clothed in false generosity which lies at the heart of the oppressors’ violence. (https://www.notion.so/Oppressed-must-oppose-the-oppressors-by-an-act-of-love-They-must-oppose-the-lovelessness-clothed-in-092e2de201e24c6a8e66dfe22ab2a085?pvs=21), During the initial stage of the struggle, the oppressed, instead of striving for liberation, tend themselves to become oppressors, or “sub-oppressors.” The very structure of their thought has been conditioned by the contradictions of the concrete, existential situation by which they were shaped. Their ideal is to be men; but for them, to be men is to be oppressors. This is their model of humanity. (https://www.notion.so/During-the-initial-stage-of-the-struggle-the-oppressed-instead-of-striving-for-liberation-tend-th-0d251e17069c4df0a798f56ee4a5c58c?pvs=21), This does not necessarily mean that the oppressed are unaware that they are downtrodden. But their perception of themselves as oppressed is impaired by their submersion in the reality of oppression. At this level, their perception of themselves as opposites of the oppressor does not yet signify engagement in a struggle to overcome the contradiction; the one pole aspires not to liberation, but to identification with its opposite pole. For them, the new man or woman themselves become oppressors; because of their identification with the oppressor, they have no consciousness of themselves as persons or as members of an oppressed class. (https://www.notion.so/This-does-not-necessarily-mean-that-the-oppressed-are-unaware-that-they-are-downtrodden-But-their-p-783c70fa6c6a43509b433ca58659b0cd?pvs=21), It is a rare peasant who, once “promoted” to overseer, does not become more of a tyrant towards his former comrades than the owner himself. (https://www.notion.so/It-is-a-rare-peasant-who-once-promoted-to-overseer-does-not-become-more-of-a-tyrant-towards-his--261e61ae613344eb96d8212f208de46b?pvs=21), One of the basic elements of the relationship between oppressor and oppressed is prescription. Every prescription represents the imposition of one individual’s choice upon another, transforming the consciousness of the person prescribed to into one that conforms with the prescriber’s consciousness. Thus, the behavior of the oppressed is a prescribe behavior, following as it does the guidelines of the oppressor.  (https://www.notion.so/One-of-the-basic-elements-of-the-relationship-between-oppressor-and-oppressed-is-prescription-Every-b9526bebd48841e7b6eefbcf7fc9fade?pvs=21), Freedom is acquired by conquest, not by gift. It must be pursued constantly and responsibly. (https://www.notion.so/Freedom-is-acquired-by-conquest-not-by-gift-It-must-be-pursued-constantly-and-responsibly-0a2638e4a1824224ad3f2066633c3bd2?pvs=21), Their struggle for freedom threatens not only the oppressor, but also their own oppressed comrades who are fearful of still greater repression. When they discover within themselves the yearning to be free, they perceive that this yearning can be transformed into reality only when the same yearning is aroused in their comrades. (https://www.notion.so/Their-struggle-for-freedom-threatens-not-only-the-oppressor-but-also-their-own-oppressed-comrades-w-60f459cff5d8467f9fef423072a984fd?pvs=21), The pedagogy of the oppressed is an instrument for their critical discovery that both they and their oppressors are manifestations of dehumanization. (https://www.notion.so/The-pedagogy-of-the-oppressed-is-an-instrument-for-their-critical-discovery-that-both-they-and-their-15bb3492e6244e33a12de13ca6450015?pvs=21), In order for the oppressed to be able to wage the struggle for their liberation, they must perceive the reality of oppression not as a closed world from which there is no exit, but as a limiting situation which they can transform. This perception is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for liberation; it must become the motivating force for liberating action. (https://www.notion.so/In-order-for-the-oppressed-to-be-able-to-wage-the-struggle-for-their-liberation-they-must-perceive--8d48899dcbc24742b7c8e0479a85eb4e?pvs=21), To affirm that men and women are persons and as persons should be free, and yet to do nothing tangible to make this affirmation a reality, is a farce.  (https://www.notion.so/To-affirm-that-men-and-women-are-persons-and-as-persons-should-be-free-and-yet-to-do-nothing-tangib-352ff27651ff43ab948b6824035dae4e?pvs=21), To deny the importance of subjectivity in the process of transforming the world and history is naive and simplistic. It is to admit the impossible: a world without people. This objectivistic position is as ingenuous as that of do not exist apart from each other, they exist in constant interaction. Marx does not espouse such a dichotomy, nor does any other critical, realistic thinker. What Marx criticized and scientifically destroyed was not subjectivity, but subjectivism and psychologism. (https://www.notion.so/To-deny-the-importance-of-subjectivity-in-the-process-of-transforming-the-world-and-history-is-naive-36f0113cb2fb473f9394e2daa5c7d5d1?pvs=21), If humankind produce social reality (which in the “inversion of the praxis” turns back upon them and conditions them), then transforming that reality is an historical task, a task for humanity. (https://www.notion.so/If-humankind-produce-social-reality-which-in-the-inversion-of-the-praxis-turns-back-upon-them-and-e4791965a7034c8ca4d0421b39fe2c6c?pvs=21), One of the gravest obstacles to the achievement of liberation is that oppressive reality absorbs those within it and thereby acts to submerge human beings’ consciousness.  (https://www.notion.so/One-of-the-gravest-obstacles-to-the-achievement-of-liberation-is-that-oppressive-reality-absorbs-tho-b077331100784078b26f39a81b8b0874?pvs=21), Functionally, oppression is domesticating. To no longer be prey to its force, one must emerge from it and turn upon it. This can be done only by means of the praxis: reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it. (https://www.notion.so/Functionally-oppression-is-domesticating-To-no-longer-be-prey-to-its-force-one-must-emerge-from-i-4b29ad12afe248fca3ef10f0fd50a511?pvs=21), A mere perception of reality not followed by this critical intervention will not lead to a transformation of objective reality - precisely because it is not a true perception. This is the case of a purely subjectivist perception by someone who forsakes objective reality and creates a false substitute. Therefore there is no critical intervention in reality because that reality is fictitious.   (https://www.notion.so/A-mere-perception-of-reality-not-followed-by-this-critical-intervention-will-not-lead-to-a-transform-92b3b29dde28488bb34a741cf408c2ba?pvs=21), When a change in objective reality would threaten the individual or class interests of the perceiver, a different type of false perception occurs. It’s because intervention would contradict the class interests of the perceiver. Thus it becomes necessary, not precisely to deny the fact, but to “see it differently.” This rationalization as a defense mechanism coincides in the end with subjectivism. (https://www.notion.so/When-a-change-in-objective-reality-would-threaten-the-individual-or-class-interests-of-the-perceiver-a3d9fa17f8a64406b0ffd6c13c4f1085?pvs=21), Action is human only when it is not merely an occupation but also a preoccupation, that is, when it is not dichotomized from reflection. (https://www.notion.so/Action-is-human-only-when-it-is-not-merely-an-occupation-but-also-a-preoccupation-that-is-when-it--e0b8ae1f5d684e38aec3226967860c46?pvs=21), The oppressed must be their own example in the struggle for their redemption. (https://www.notion.so/The-oppressed-must-be-their-own-example-in-the-struggle-for-their-redemption-311233876f1b4017ae12067af9c425f8?pvs=21), Pedagogy which begins with the egoistic interests of the oppressors (an egoism cloaked in the false generosity of paternalism) and makes of the oppressed the objects of its humanitarianism, itself maintains and embodies oppression. It is an instrument of dehumanization. (https://www.notion.so/Pedagogy-which-begins-with-the-egoistic-interests-of-the-oppressors-an-egoism-cloaked-in-the-false--40e9c482de35463ea0989cc58d174521?pvs=21), The pedagogy of the oppressed, as a humanist and libertarian pedagogy, has two distinct stages. In the first, the oppressed unveil the world of oppression and through the praxis commit themselves to its transformation. In the second stage, in which the reality of oppression has already been transformed, this pedagogy ceases to belong to the oppressed and becomes a pedagogy of all people in the process of permanent liberation. In the first stage this confrontation occurs through the change in the way the oppressed perceive the world of oppression; in the second stage, through the expulsion of the myths created and developed in the old order, which like specters haunt the new structure emerging from the revolutionary transformation.  (https://www.notion.so/The-pedagogy-of-the-oppressed-as-a-humanist-and-libertarian-pedagogy-has-two-distinct-stages-In-t-f5b88553d399461485ad607640b61e02?pvs=21), Violence is initiated by those who oppress, who exploit, who fail to recognize others as persons. It is not the unloved who initiate disaffection, but those who cannot love because they love only themselves. It is not the helpless, subject to terror, who initiate terror, but the violent, who with their power create the concrete situation which begets the “rejects of life.” (https://www.notion.so/Violence-is-initiated-by-those-who-oppress-who-exploit-who-fail-to-recognize-others-as-persons-It-c3ebcf395def4957ad12bb59e820fc99?pvs=21), For the oppressors, however, it is always the oppressed (whom they obviously never call “the oppressed” but - depending on whether they are fellow countrymen or not - “those people” or “the blind and envious masses” or “savages” or “natives” or “subversives”) who are disaffected, who are “violent”, ”barbaric”, “wicked”, or “ferocious” when they react to the violence of the oppressors.  (https://www.notion.so/For-the-oppressors-however-it-is-always-the-oppressed-whom-they-obviously-never-call-the-oppress-c39a98ac46b4488dad30d81cab3296ad?pvs=21), Consciously or unconsciously, the act of rebellion by the oppressed can initiate love. Whereas the violence of the oppressors prevents the oppressed from being fully human, the response of the latter to this violence is grounded in the desire to pursue the right to be human. As the oppressors dehumanize others and violate their rights, they themselves also become dehumanized. As the oppressed, fighting to be human, take away the oppressors’ power to dominate and suppress, they restore to the oppressors the humanity they had lost in the exercise of oppression. (https://www.notion.so/Consciously-or-unconsciously-the-act-of-rebellion-by-the-oppressed-can-initiate-love-Whereas-the-v-3fab5a428d6b4e69b7e247c67eff0ff7?pvs=21), If the goal of the oppressed is to become fully human, they will not achieve their goal by merely reversing the terms of the contradiction, by simply changing poles. (https://www.notion.so/If-the-goal-of-the-oppressed-is-to-become-fully-human-they-will-not-achieve-their-goal-by-merely-re-f0a38b494e884788a82dd5dc30b383d1?pvs=21), The former oppressors do not feel liberated. On the contrary, they genuinely consider themselves to be oppressed. Conditioned by the experience of oppressing others, any situation other than their former seems to them like oppression. Any restriction on this way of life, in the name of the rights of the community, appears to the former oppressors as a profound violation of their individual rights一although they had no respect for the millions who suffered and died of hunger, pain, sorrow, and despair. For the oppressors, “human beings” refers only to themselves; other people are “things.” For the oppressors, there exists only one right: their right to live in peace, over against the right, not always even recognized, but simply conceded, of the oppressed to survival. And they make this concession only because the existence of the oppressed is necessary to their own existence. (https://www.notion.so/The-former-oppressors-do-not-feel-liberated-On-the-contrary-they-genuinely-consider-themselves-to--83c842a0dbca497ca209749878634c34?pvs=21), This climate creates in the oppressor a strongly possessive consciousness - possessive of the world and of men and women. Apart from direct, concrete, material possession of the world and of people, the oppressor consciousness could not understand itself - could not even exist. Fromm said of this consciousness that, without such possession, “it would lose contact with the world.” For the oppressors, what is worthwhile is to have more - always more - even at the cost of the oppressed having less or having nothing. For them, to be is to have and to be the class of the “haves”.  (https://www.notion.so/This-climate-creates-in-the-oppressor-a-strongly-possessive-consciousness-possessive-of-the-world--6341887ecc2044819c025fc460ac29e5?pvs=21), The oppressor consciousness tends to transform everything surrounding it into an object of its domination. The earth, property, production, the creations of people, people themselves, time - everything is reduced to the status of objects at its disposal. In their unrestrained eagerness to possess, the oppressors develop the conviction that it is possible for them to transform everything into objects of their purchasing power; hence their strictly materialistic concept of existence. Money is the measure of all things, and profit the primary goal. (https://www.notion.so/The-oppressor-consciousness-tends-to-transform-everything-surrounding-it-into-an-object-of-its-domin-0ebdac6bc9a149df8f58ef232b614ac4?pvs=21), If the humanization of the oppressed signifies subversion, so also does their freedom; hence the necessity for constant control. And the more the oppressors control the oppressed, the more they change them into apparently inanimate “things.” This tendency of the oppressor consciousness to “in-animate” everything and everyone it encounters, in its eagerness to possess, unquestionably corresponds with a tendency to sadism. Sadistic love is a perverted love - a love of death, not of life.  (https://www.notion.so/If-the-humanization-of-the-oppressed-signifies-subversion-so-also-does-their-freedom-hence-the-nec-6fce35f25f964fae99d011a846bf75d3?pvs=21), The pleasure in complete domination over another person (or other animate creature) is the very essence of the sadistic drive. Another way of formulating the same thought is to say that the aim of sadism is to transform a man into a thing, something animate into something inanimate, since by complete and absolute control the living loses one essential quality of life - freedom. (https://www.notion.so/The-pleasure-in-complete-domination-over-another-person-or-other-animate-creature-is-the-very-esse-3787ed97d9e941b79cc238c95a0b4e93?pvs=21), More and more, the oppressors are using science and technology as unquestionably powerful instruments for their purpose: the maintenance of the oppressive order through manipulation and repression. (https://www.notion.so/More-and-more-the-oppressors-are-using-science-and-technology-as-unquestionably-powerful-instrument-9afe5fbd179c4696b89d4c25ad86ba17?pvs=21), It happens, however, that as they cease to be exploiters or indifferent spectators or simply the heirs of exploitation and move to the side of the exploited, they almost always bring with them the marks of their origin: their prejudices and their deformations, which include a lack of confidence in the people’s ability to think, to want, and to know. (https://www.notion.so/It-happens-however-that-as-they-cease-to-be-exploiters-or-indifferent-spectators-or-simply-the-hei-a1736cec6a1f4757a8aafc38ab0be056?pvs=21), The generosity of the oppressors is nourished by an unjust order, which must be maintained in order to justify that generosity. (https://www.notion.so/The-generosity-of-the-oppressors-is-nourished-by-an-unjust-order-which-must-be-maintained-in-order--ce97856771994dfb90e86add8eb8f18e?pvs=21), Trusting the people is the indispensable precondition for revolutionary change. To affirm this commitment but to consider oneself the proprietor of revolutionary wisdom - which must then be given to (or imposed on) the people - is to retain the old ways. This conversion is so radical as not to allow of ambiguous behavior. The convert who approaches the people but feels alarm at each step they take, each doubt they express, and each suggestion they offer, and attempts to impose his “status,” remains nostalgic towards his origins.  (https://www.notion.so/Trusting-the-people-is-the-indispensable-precondition-for-revolutionary-change-To-affirm-this-commi-027eb0de483e4ff68dd1be28b648d5ac?pvs=21), While the settler or the policeman has the right the livelong day to strike the native, to insult him and to make him crawl to them, you will see the native reaching for his knife at the slightest hostile or aggressive glance cast on him by another native; for the last resort of the native is to defend his personality against his brother. (https://www.notion.so/While-the-settler-or-the-policeman-has-the-right-the-livelong-day-to-strike-the-native-to-insult-hi-510953b087ae4359945be094f9cd6a0d?pvs=21), At a certain point in their existential experience the oppressed feel an irresistible attraction towards the oppressors and their way of life. Sharing this way of life becomes an overpowering aspiration. In their, alienation, the oppressed want at any cost to resemble the oppressors, to imitate them, to follow them. This phenomenon is especially prevalent in the middle class oppressed, who yearn to be equal to the “eminent” men and women of the upper class. Albert Memmi, in an exceptional analysis of the “colonized mentality,” refers to the contempt he felt towards the colonizer, mixed with “passionate” attraction towards him.  (https://www.notion.so/At-a-certain-point-in-their-existential-experience-the-oppressed-feel-an-irresistible-attraction-tow-332fec6e8dbe493b9318e68a7215c140?pvs=21), Self-depreciation is another characteristic of the oppressed, which derive from their internalization of the opinion the oppressors hold of them. So often do they hear that they are good for nothing, know nothing and are incapable of learning anything - that they are sick, lazy, and unproductive - that in the end they become convinced of their own unfitness. “The peasant feels inferior to the boss because the boss seems to be the only one who knows things and is able to run things.” (https://www.notion.so/Self-depreciation-is-another-characteristic-of-the-oppressed-which-derive-from-their-internalizatio-acc6aac3322a466c8fee30ab7b8d859c?pvs=21)",,High culture

Two such patients, for instance, showed a newfound tendency to lie, manipulate, and break the rules.

In other words, they were among the highest possessors of traits that hinged on manipulation and deception.

Once you’ve decided to get on the sled, and have eased yourself over the edge of the hill, it’s too late to break. It starts with a small thing. A credit in a candy store. A fudged line in a financial statement. A rogue quote massaged ever so slightly to make your case more compelling. And lo and behold, nobody notices. And even though you thought it was just the once, because the circumstances were so extreme and you were in such a tight corner, those circumstances somehow never get any better. You’re always pressed for time, for money, for energy, for mental space. Always needing to do just a bit too much with a bit too little. And once you do it once, and successfully at that, the temptation to do it again, do it more, do it differently, grows. Rather than a cut corner, it becomes another tool in your arsenal. It’s like in the Mafia movies: the only one that matters is the first one you kill. After that, piece of cake.

The caterpillars simply pretended to be queen ants: they had learned the distinction between worker and queen sounds, and now their pupae and larvae had evolved to make queen-like noises. Even when the ant colonies were low on food, the impostors would receive preferential treatment. After all, they were potential queens. Since then, the researchers have learned that at least twelve other species of butterfly employ the same technique. Mimic a queen, and let yourself be carried into the ants’ nest without raising so much as a foot or a wing in labor.

Stapel had never even run many of the studies in question; he’d merely created the results that would support the theory that, he was sure, was accurate.

Instead, one of the factors that emerges is circumstance: it’s not who you are, byt where you happen to be at this particular moment in your life. If you’re feeling isolated or lonely, it turns out you’re particularly vulnerable. Likewise if you’re going through a job loss, divorce, serious injury, or other major life change; are experiencing a downturn in personal finances, or are concerned with being in debt. People in debt, in fact, are also more likely to fall for fraud that’s completely unrelated to finances, like weight-loss products.

Often, patient, levelheaded people will go a bit crazy in the wake of a major life change - we become more impulsive, less stable, riskier versions of ourselves.

People climbing that first mountain spend a lot of time thinking about reputation management. They are always keeping score. How do I measure up? Where do I rank? As the psychologist James Hollis puts it, at that stage we have a tendency to think, I am what the world says I am.

The only way our is to rebalance, to build a culture that steers people toward relation, community, and commitment - the things we most deeply yearn for, yet undermine with our hyper-individualistic way of life (https://www.notion.so/Our-society-suffers-from-a-crisis-of-connection-a-crisis-of-solidarity-We-live-in-a-culture-of-hyp-df5f99c114824c5d98bf5420e5c2749c?pvs=21), I now think the rampant individualism of our current culture is a capastrophe. The emphasis on self-individual success, self-fulfillment, individual freedom, self-actualization - is a catastrophe.

Our marriage of twenty-seven years ended, and, in the wake of that failed commitment, I moved into an apartment. I relized I had a lot of friendships that didn’t run deep. Few people confided in me, because I did not give off a vibe that encouraged vulnerability. I was too busy, on the move.

And that is what was happened to us.

Floating and plagued by uncertainty, they want to know what specifically they should do with their lives. So tell them that the purpose of life is to be free, that freedom leads to hapiness, that they should look inside themselves, find their true inner passions, define their own values, do what they love.

If you spend your days merely consuming random experiences, you will begin to feel like a scattered consumer. If you want to sample something from every aisle in the grocery store of life, you turn yourself into a chooser, the sort of self-obsessed person who is always thinking about himself and his choices and is eventually paralyzed by self-consciousness.

We end up with “liquid modernity”. In the age of the smartphone, the friction costs involved in making or breaking any transaction or relationship approach zero.

But man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail if he can interest their self-love in his favour, and shew them that it is for their own advantage to do for him what he requires of them. Whoever offers to another a bargain of any kind, proposes to do this. Give me that which I want, and you shall have this which you want, is the meaning of every such offer; and it is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far greater part of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages. Nobody but a beggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow citizens.
